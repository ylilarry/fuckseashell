# How to Use Terminal and Bash

Terminal and Bash on MacOS and Linux are basically identical. A good tutorial
can be found here: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash

However, if you are running Windows, I suggest you use our [fuckseashell Docker
image](how-to-docker.md), so that when you open the VSC terminal, you will have
the same experience as MacOS/Linux users.

Make sure that you learn the following commands:

* `cd`
* `echo`
* `ls`

And make sure you know the following concepts:

* file paths and directory paths
* environment variables
* `.bashrc`

In fact, you don't need to know more than these commands and concepts.
